# What is Pair Programming

>“All code to be sent into production is created by  **two people working together** at a single computer. Pair programming increases software quality without impacting time to deliver. It is counter intuitive, but 2 people working at a single computer will add as much functionality as two working separately except that it will be much higher in quality. With **increased quality** comes **big savings later** in the project.” --http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/pair.html

1. All code to be sent into production is created by  **two people working together** at a single computer
   1. all code??? well, one write, and one review. This also works.
2. pair improve quality, which will save future works.
   1. agree
3. pair produce as mush functionality as two single ====> ??????
4. Context-sharing is not the biggest intent of pair programming??

# How to Pair Programming

> It’s important to approach pair programming with the mindset that all of these skills can be improved and honed by practice, reflection, and adaption. If it’s hard for you today, it does not have to stay that way - hopefully this deck can give some inspiration to try new things and keep improving. 

There are some skills, but they can be evolved.

Some skills:

1. programming with another person
2. communication
3. giving & receiving feedback
4. keeping focus
5. time management
6. task organisation
7. empathy??????
   1. 共情？？？

## Approaches

1. DRIVER AND NAVIGATOR
2. PING PONG
   1. yes. 
3. STRONG  PAIRING
4. PAIR DEVELOPMENT
5. POMODORO
6. HOUSE-KEEPING

Which one have you ever tried? Your feeling? Especially which part do you feel uncomfortble?

What approaches will you adopt later?

Choose an approach  => Are you comfortable with all the skills? => think about the win-win benefits you want most => adjust the approach as long as you can get the benefits you want.

# Benefits of Pair Programming

There're a lot of benefits. Even adopting different skills/techs provides particularly different benefits. However, **what benefits do you want? What benefits does the project/team want? What benefits you want most to achieve win-win for both you and your team? How do you match your intent with you pair's?**

* Helps to keep focus
  * yes but maybe uncomfortable
* Code Review “on-the-go”
  * agree. Code review need context sometimes.
* Knowledge Sharing
  * agree
* Combine 2 modes of thinking: Tactical and Strategic
  * yes but need more caution when taking in to action.
  * about empathy. It may disrupt another's thinking, which as a result, makes the experience tiring.
* Collective Code Ownership
  * agree
* Reflection
  * well, yes. But a lot of talk is exhausting.
* Keep team’s “WIP” low
  * yes but not the main pain-point
* Fast onboarding of new team members
  * agree

> I think there is a point to this - **pairing is about improving design and minimizing mistakes**. Rote code that's simple to write yields little opportunities for pairing to make a difference.
