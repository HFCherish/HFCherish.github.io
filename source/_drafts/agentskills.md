**Building a skill for an agent is like putting together an onboarding guide for a new hire**. Instead of building fragmented, custom-designed agents for each use case, anyone can now specialize their agents with composable capabilities by capturing and sharing their procedural knowledge

**Progressive disclosure** is the core design principle that makes Agent Skills flexible and scalable. Like a well-organized manual that starts with a table of contents, then specific chapters, and finally a detailed appendix, skills let Claude load information only as needed.
